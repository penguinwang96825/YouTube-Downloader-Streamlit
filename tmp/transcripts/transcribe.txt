Gortheon County Kerry are investigating the theft of up to 60 sheep on Mount Brandon. One of the farmers is offering a reward for information leading to the return of the use which are worth thousands of euro. Last Saturday, Mikei Jojou shay brought his flock of scotch sheep down from the mountain common edge ahead of lamings. He discovered over 50 were missing, allowing for a number of deaths and the stress Mikei is convinced over 45 sheep have been stolen. What's about an 8? That'd be a full mondeau around 8 and so it'd be a bright outing that could anyone go for the mountains around 9. Well, that was a 45 sheep missing like in the lamings and there wasn't any sheep to scotch out and nice be too money like. Can be done about enough. Some sort of, you know what? Some sort of a, you know. Like he's next door neighbor says some of his sheep have also been stolen. Come back, come back, come back. I'm missing about 10 kilos. This is not all that difficult. All the guy to use have a good yard. Have a good yard and go at night some mone train night just for the dagger around him for the monotroller or walk him and then probably somebody else to pick him up. Whoever does do what he's doing.
