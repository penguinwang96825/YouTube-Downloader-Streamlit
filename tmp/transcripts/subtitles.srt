0:00:09.800000 --> 0:00:11.800000 use which are worth thousands of euro.

0:00:11.800000 --> 0:00:22.680000 Last Saturday, Mikei Jojou shay brought his flock of scotch sheep down from the mountain

0:00:22.680000 --> 0:00:25.360000 common edge ahead of lamings.

0:00:29.920000 --> 0:00:33.920000 the stress Mikei is convinced over 45 sheep have been stolen.

0:00:33.920000 --> 0:00:35.920000 What's about an 8?

0:00:35.920000 --> 0:00:39.600000 That'd be a full mondeau around 8 and so it'd be a bright outing that could anyone

0:00:39.600000 --> 0:00:41.600000 go for the mountains around 9.

0:00:41.600000 --> 0:00:46.320000 Well, that was a 45 sheep missing like in the lamings and there wasn't any sheep to

0:00:46.320000 --> 0:00:48.320000 scotch out and nice be too money like.

0:00:48.320000 --> 0:00:52.320000 Can be done about enough.

0:01:02.920000 --> 0:01:03.920000 This is not all that difficult.
